# HONOURS PROJECT: Join Ordering with Learned Cardinality
As part of this project, I implemented four different join ordering algorithms in Python
and studied the impact of different synthetic selectivity ratios on the quality of join
ordering plans generated by these algorithms. For each set of selectivity ratios, I 
compared the join ordering returned by each algorithm using that set with the “optimal”
join ordering computed by a dynamic programming algorithm using the same set. In
this way, I was able to measure how “far away” the target algorithm behaves from the
optimal dynamic programming method.
